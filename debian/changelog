live-debconfig (4.0~a2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Daniel Baumann ]
  * Adding missing space in live-debconfig/sysvinit/lxc-disable-services
    default, thanks to Jon Severinsson <jon@severinsson.net>.
  * Also adding kmod to disabled services within lxc containers in
    sysvinit script.

  [ Jon Severinsson ]
  * Remove, rather than disable, the umount* initscripts in lxc
    containers.

  [ Daniel Baumann ]
  * Explicitly listing umountfs and umountroot for remove in sysvinit
    script to be on the conservative side, instead of using 'umount*'
    pattern to match them.

  [ Jon Severinsson ]
  * Add mountkernfs.sh and mountall.sh to the list of services disabled
    in lxc containers.
